# SignUp Application Full Stack

I created this project to understand how to integrate a React Fronted with a Node Backend.

## Available Scripts

#### Run the Frontend

```jsx
cd client
npm start
```

Runs the frontend in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### Run the Backend

```jsx
cd server
npm run start
```
Run the backend server on your system on [http://localhost:4000/app/signup](http://localhost:4000/app/signup)
